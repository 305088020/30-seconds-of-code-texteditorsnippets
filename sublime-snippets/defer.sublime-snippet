	<description>Defers invoking a function until the current call stack has cleared.  Use `setTimeout()` with a timeout of 1ms to add a new event to the browser event queue and allow the rendering engine to complete its work. Use the spread (`...`) operator to supply the function with an arbitrary number of arguments.</description>
