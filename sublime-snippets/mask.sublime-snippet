	<description>Replaces all but the last `num` of characters with the specified mask character.  Use `String.slice()` to grab the portion of the characters that need to be masked and use `String.replace()` with a regexp to replace every character with the mask character. Concatenate the masked characters with the remaining unmasked portion of the string. Omit the second argument, `num`, to keep a default of `4` characters unmasked. If `num` is negative, the unmasked characters will be at the start of the string. Omit the third argument, `mask`, to use a default character of `'*'` for the mask.</description>
