	<description>Returns a list of elements that exist in both arrays, after applying the provided function to each array element of both.  Create a `Set` by applying `fn` to all elements in `b`, then use `Array.filter()` on `a` to only keep elements, which produce values contained in `b` when `fn` is applied to them.</description>
