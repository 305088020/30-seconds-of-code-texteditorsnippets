	<description>Mutates the original array to filter out the values at the specified indexes.  Use `Array.filter()` and `Array.includes()` to pull out the values that are not needed. Use `Array.length = 0` to mutate the passed in an array by resetting it's length to zero and `Array.push()` to re-populate it with only the pulled values. Use `Array.push()` to keep track of pulled values</description>
